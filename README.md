### Saving Drawings

`draw` automatically saves your latest masterpiece to `/tmp/draw.txt` by
default. You can change this location by setting the environment variable
`$DRAW_FILE`.

```
export DRAW_FILE=/path/to/draw.txt
```

To view this drawing use `cat` or `mv` the drawing to somewhere more permanent.
If you already know you want to save the drawing, run `draw` with the file path
where you want to save the drawing: `draw masterpiece.txt`.
